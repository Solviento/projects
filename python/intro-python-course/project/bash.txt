Need to instantiate classes, not refer to the class itself
Must also explicitly declare 'self' in functions that 
pertain to custom classes - since runtime complains that
when we instantiate a class and call a function from that
instantiation, the 'self' parameter becomes implicit, even
if it is called as obj.sum().
