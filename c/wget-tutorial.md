wget (linux command)

	Effortless way of downloading files from a URL with a bunch of customizable
	options at your disposal.

	wget -p -r -k http://www.someweb.com

	-p : download all types of files (images, text, pdf, etc)
	-r : recursively download entire website (not just single html)
	-k : makes local copy easier for viewing
